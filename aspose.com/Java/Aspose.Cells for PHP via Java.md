## Get Started with Aspose.Cells for PHP via Java

Aspose.Cells for PHP via Java consists of two individual parts, the script wrapper (aspose.cells.php) and Aspose.Cells for Java. These components communicate via PHP/Java Bridge whereas both require separate environments & processes for execution.

### Prerequisites

1. JDK
2. PHP/Java Bridge
3. Web Server like Tomcat
4. PHP

## Installation

1. Install Tomcat on any location such as `\java\apache-tomcat-9.0.24`.
2. Copy JavaBridge.war to `webapps` folder of Tomcat such as `\java\apache-tomcat-9.0.24\webapps`.
3. Copy *aspose-cells-xx.x.jar* and *bcprov-jdk15on-xxx.jar* to `lib` folder such as `\java\apache-tomcat-9.0.24\lib`.
4. Run `\bin\startup.bat`, *JavaBridge.war* will be deployed to `\java\apache-tomcat-9.0.24\webapps\JavaBridge`.
5. Test [http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php](http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php) to ensure that PHP works fine.
6. Copy *aspose.cells.php* and *example.php* to `\java\apache-tomcat-9.0.24\webapps\JavaBridge`.
7. Open [http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/example.php](http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/example.php) or create your own PHP file as follows.

You will find the Jar and PHP library in the `vendor/aspose/cells` folder.

### Sample Usage

```php
<?php
require_once("http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");
require_once("aspose.cells.php");

use aspose\cells;
use aspose\cells\Workbook;
use aspose\cells\CellsHelper;
use aspose\cells\Color;

$workbook = new Workbook();
$workbook->getWorksheets()->get("Sheet1")->getCells()->get("A1")->putValue("testing...");
$workbook->save("result.xlsx");

echo aspose\cells\BorderType::BOTTOM_BORDER;
