// set sender information
message->set_From(u"from@domain.com");
    
// add TO recipients
message->get_To()->Add(u"to1@domain.com");
message->get_To()->Add(u"to2@domain.com");
    
// add CC recipients
message->get_CC()->Add(u"cc1@domain.com");

// create instance of type MailMessage
System::SharedPtr<MailMessage> msg = System::MakeObject<MailMessage>();
msg->set_From(MailAddress::to_MailAddress(u"sender@domain.com"));
msg->set_To(MailAddressCollection::to_MailAddressCollection(u"recipient@ domain.com "));
msg->set_Subject(u"Sending message from exchange server");
