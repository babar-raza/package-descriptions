# C++ API to Perform OCR via GPU

It is an OCR API that enhances your C++ apps to perform image recognition using `GPU` and `CUDA` technology.

## Image OCR API Features

- Recognize characters from images.
- Calculate the skew angle of images.
- Currently it supports English language.
- Auto-align image and autodetect text areas.
- Get a single line and recognize it.

## New Features & Enhancements in Version 20.7

- New `ML` model with improved recognition.
- Ability to recognize text in the tables.
- Added image recognition using `GPU` and `CUDA` technology (available in separate assembly `Aspose.Ocr.Cpp.Gpu`).

## Getting Started with Aspose.OCR for C++

Are you ready to give Aspose.OCR for C++ a try? Simply execute `Install-Package Aspose.Ocr.Cpp-GPU` from Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package. If you already have Aspose.OCR for C++ and want to upgrade the version, please execute `Update-Package Aspose.Ocr.Cpp-GPU` to get the latest version.

Execute the following code snippet to see how Aspose.OCR API performs with your own samples or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-C) for other common usage scenarios.

## Perform OCR on PNG Image via C++ Code

```cpp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-ocr/Aspose.OCR-for-C
std::string image_path = "../Data/Source/sample.png";
const wchar_t* result = aspose::ocr::recognize_page(image_path.c_str());
std::wcout << result << L'\n';
```

## Evaluation Version Limitation

The evaluation version of Aspose.OCR for C++ limits the number of characters extracted from an image to 300.
