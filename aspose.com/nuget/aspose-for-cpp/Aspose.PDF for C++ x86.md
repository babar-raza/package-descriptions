- `C++`-styled iteration has been added over the library containers. `begin/end/cbegin/cend/rbegin/rend` methods are now present where possible.
- Translation of `System::String` class to and from various `STL` string types have been improved. Respective constructors and conversion operators were added (yet explicit, to avoid undesired invocations of suboptimal operations). Also, the `String` class is now working fine with `STL` streams.
- Various other enhancements of the API in terms of performance and memory-related issues.
