## Create XLSX Excel File from Scratch via C#
You can execute below code snippet to see how Aspose.Cells API performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-cells/Aspose.Cells-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.

```csharp
// initiate an instance of Workbook
var book = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook();
// access first (default) worksheet
var sheet = book.Worksheets[0];
// access CellsCollection of first worksheet
var cells = sheet.Cells;
// write HelloWorld to cells A1
cells["A1"].Value = "Hello World";
// save spreadsheet to disc
book.Save("output.xlsx", SaveFormat.Xlsx);
```
## Convert Excel Files to PDF, XPS & HTML
Aspose.Cells for .NET is capable of converting spreadsheets to numerous other popular formats including PDF, XPS & HTML formats while maintaining the highest visual fidelity. The conversion process is simple, configurable and reliable.

```csharp
// load file to be converted
var workbook = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir + "template.xlsx");
// save in different formats
workbook.Save(dir + "output.pdf", Aspose.Cells.SaveFormat.Pdf);
workbook.Save(dir + "output.xps", Aspose.Cells.SaveFormat.XPS);
workbook.Save(dir + "output.html", Aspose.Cells.SaveFormat.Html);
```

## Encrypt Excel File with C#
```
var workbook = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook(dir+ "template.xls");

// specify XOR encryption type
workbook.SetEncryptionOptions(EncryptionType.XOR, 40);

// specify strong encryption type (RC4,Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider)
workbook.SetEncryptionOptions(EncryptionType.StrongCryptographicProvider, 128);

// protect the file
workbook.Settings.Password = "1234";

// save the file
workbook.Save(dir+ "output.xls");
```
## Create an Excel Line Chart via C#
```
var workbook = new Aspose.Cells.Workbook();

// add a new worksheet to the Excel object
int sheetIndex = workbook.Worksheets.Add();

// obtain the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
Worksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[sheetIndex];

// add sample values to cells
worksheet.Cells["A1"].PutValue(50);
worksheet.Cells["A2"].PutValue(100);
worksheet.Cells["A3"].PutValue(150);
worksheet.Cells["B1"].PutValue(4);
worksheet.Cells["B2"].PutValue(20);
worksheet.Cells["B3"].PutValue(50);

// add a chart to the worksheet
int chartIndex = worksheet.Charts.Add(Aspose.Cells.Charts.ChartType.Line, 5, 0, 15, 5);

// access the instance of the newly added chart
var chart = worksheet.Charts[chartIndex];

// add chart data source from "A1" to "B3"
chart.NSeries.Add("A1:B3", true);

// save the Excel file
workbook.Save( dir + "output.xls");
