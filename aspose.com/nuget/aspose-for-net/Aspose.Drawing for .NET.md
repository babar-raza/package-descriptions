# 2D Drawing Engine for .NET Platforms

[Aspose.Drawing for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/drawing/net) is a cross-platform 2D drawing engine with System.Drawing compatible API.

Our drawing engine supports rendering vector graphics (such as lines, curves, and figures) and text (in a variety of fonts, sizes, and styles) onto raster images represented by array of pixels in memory. Images can be saved in some of popularly used graphics file formats (BMP, PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF).

Aspose.Drawing is a pure .NET library. We don’t use any external native rendering engine, so Aspose.Drawing can be safely run from any restricted environment such as Windows of ASP.NET service.

## Graphic File Processing Features

- Creating bitmaps from scratch or loading from files.
- Drawing lines, Bézier curves, splines and arcs.
- Drawing shapes such as rectangle, polygon, eclipse, etc.
- Processing and drawing graphics paths.
- Rendering text with different fonts and styles.
- Using different pen widths and styles.
- Using solid and texture brushes.
- Alpha blending and anti-aliasing lines and shapes.
- Working with clip regions.
- Using affine transformations.

## New Features & Enhancements in Version 20.7

- Addition of the `LinearGradientBrush` functionality.
- Updated the `TextureBrush`.
- Reworked the `PrivateFontCollection` implementation.
- Addition of the functionality for `EncoderParameter(Encoder, long)`.

## Read & Write Drawing Formats

BMP, PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF

## Platform Independence

The project is based on managed .NET core and does not have dependencies on native code and libraries, with the rendering algorithms working the same way on all supported platforms.

Aspose.Drawing for .NET supports any 32-bit or 64-bit operating system where .NET Framework or .NET Core is installed including, but not limited to:

- Microsoft Windows desktop (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10) and server operating systems (2003, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2019)
- Windows Azure

It also supports .NET Framework version 2.0 and .NET Core 2.0 or later. You can use Aspose.Drawing for .NET to develop applications in any development environment that targets the .NET platform. However, Microsoft Visual Studio 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 are explicitly supported.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Drawing for .NET

Are you ready to give Aspose.Drawing for .NET a try? Simply execute `Install-Package Aspose.Drawing` from Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package. If you already have Aspose.Drawing for .NET and want to upgrade the version, please execute `Update-Package Aspose.Drawing` to get the latest version.

## Create New Bitmap using C# Code

You can execute below code snippet to see how Aspose.Drawing API performs in your own environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-drawing/Aspose.Drawing-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios. 

```csharp
// For complete examples and data files, please go to https://github.com/aspose-drawing/Aspose.Drawing-for-.NET
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(1000, 800, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb);
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

Pen pen = new Pen(Color.FromKnownColor(KnownColor.Blue), 2);
graphics.DrawArc(pen, 0, 0, 700, 700, 0, 180);

bitmap.Save(RunExamples.GetDataDir() + @"LinesCurvesShapes\DrawArc_out.png");
```
