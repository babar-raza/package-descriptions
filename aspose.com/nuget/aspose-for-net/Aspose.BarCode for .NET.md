# Barcode Generation & Recognition Library for .NET Applications

[Aspose.BarCode for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/barcode/net) doesn't just create or recognize barcodes but it provides a complete framework to control almost everything about barcodes. Developers can customization the barcode's appearance including bar height, color, margins, borders and so on. While scanning for barcode, developers can specify area where a barcode can be found as well as direct the engine to look for rotated barcodes.

## Barcode API Features

- Read 1D & 2D barcodes at any angle.
- Easily print barcode labels to physical or virtual printers.
- [Export barcode as XML](https://docs.aspose.com/display/barcodenet/Barcode+in+XML).
- Support for [barcode supplement data and checksum](https://docs.aspose.com/display/barcodenet/Use+Checksum+and+Supplement+Data).
- Optimized code128 encoding.
- Specify image area to scan barcode.
- Create device resolution dependent images.

## New Features in Version 20.3

- Generate *DataMatrix* barcode with `X12`, `EDIFACT` and `Base 256` encoding.

## Public API and Backward Incompatible Changes

## Generate a Barcode Label with Code128

Try the following snippet to see how Aspose.BarCode API performs in your environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-barcode/Aspose.BarCode-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios.
```csharp
// instantiate object and set different barcode properties
BarcodeGenerator  generator = new BarcodeGenerator (EncodeTypes.Code128, "1234567");
generator.Parameters.Barcode.XDimension.Millimeters = 1f;

// save the image to your system and set its image format to Jpeg
generator.Save(dir + "output.jpg", BarCodeImageFormat.Jpeg);
```

## Hide Barcode Text from the PNG Label via C# Code

Aspose.BarCode for .NET allows you to customize various properties of barcodes, such as, borders, color, type, bar height as well as barcode text. Following example shows, how simple it is to hide the barcode text using C#.

```csharp
string codeText = "This text is hidden.\n" + "This text is hidden.\n"; ;

// instantiate barcode object and set CodeText, Symbology , and  CodeLocation
BarcodeGenerator  generator = new BarcodeGenerator(EncodeTypes.DataMatrix, codeText);
generator.Parameters.Barcode.CodeTextParameters.Location = CodeLocation.None;
generator.Save(dir + "output.png", BarCodeImageFormat.Png);
```
