text.FirstAlignment = new Cad3DPoint(300, 40);
```

## Export DXF Drawing to PDF using C#
Aspose.CAD for .NET enables your applications to perform various export operations on AutoCAD files. It supports to read and export ACAD Proxy Entities as well as IGES files. Similarly you can load a DGN file and convert it to a raster image or PDF file format. 

The following example highlights, how to export DXF file to PDF format using simple C# code:
```csharp
var rasterizationOptions = new CadRasterizationOptions();
rasterizationOptions.PageWidth = 500;
rasterizationOptions.PageHeight = 500;

rasterizationOptions.Layouts = new string[] { "Model" };
var pdfOptions = new PdfOptions();
pdfOptions.VectorRasterizationOptions = rasterizationOptions;
cadImage.Save(dir + "output.pdf", pdfOptions);
```
