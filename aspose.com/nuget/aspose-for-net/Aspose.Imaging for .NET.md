# .NET API for Image Processing

It is a [standalone Imaging API](https://products.aspose.com/imaging/net) consists of C# routines that enable your .NET applications to draw as well as perform basic to advanced level processing of raster & vector images.

Aspose.Imaging for .NET offers robust image compression and high processing speed through native byte access and a range of efficient algorithms. It not only manipulate, export and convert images but also lets you dynamically draw objects using pixel manipulation and Graphics Path.

## Imaging API Features

- Draw raster images with graphics.
- Draw vector images.
- Converting images to various formats.
- [Apply masking](https://docs.aspose.com/display/imagingnet/Applying+Masking+to+Images) as well as [Median & Wiener](https://docs.aspose.com/display/imagingnet/Applying+Median+and+Wiener+Filters) filters.
- Crop, rotate & resize images via API.
- De-skew & transform images.
- Set image properties.

    image.Save(dir + "output.jpg");
}
```

## Recover a Broken TIFF

You can programmatically recover a damaged TIFF file with the help of Aspose.Imaging for .NET API as demonstrated below.

```csharp
// create an instance of LoadOptions and set LoadOptions properties
var loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.DataRecoveryMode = DataRecoveryMode.ConsistentRecover;
loadOptions.DataBackgroundColor = Color.Red;

// create an instance of Image and load a damaged image by passing the instance of LoadOptions
using (var image = Image.Load(dir + "template.tiff", loadOptions))
{
    // do processing
}
```
