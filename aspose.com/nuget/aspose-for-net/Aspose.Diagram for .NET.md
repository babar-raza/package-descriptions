# .NET API for Microsoft VisioÂ® File Formats

[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net) API is a solution for Microsoft Visio file manipulation requirements. It allows the .NET applications to read, write, export and process Microsoft Visio diagrams while supporting all Visio objects & properties including shapes, pages, images, shape masters, stencils, text, layers, header, footers, user-defined cells, hyperlinks, file protection, geometries, text boxes, and comments. 

Aspose.Diagram for .NET can also be used to [apply protection to the Microsoft Visio drawings](https://docs.aspose.com/display/diagramnet/Working+with+Protection) by locking backgrounds, stencils (master) as well as  shapes and styles to avoid any accidental amendments.

## Visio File Processing Features

- Create Microsoft Visio diagrams from scratch via API.
- Read or write Microsoft Visio drawings.
- [Export Visio diagrams](https://docs.aspose.com/display/diagramnet/How+to+Convert+a+Visio+Diagram) to various popular formats including PDF, images, HTML and more.
- Print Visio diagrams on physical or virtual printer.
- Access Visio diagram properties for manipulation or just inspection.
- Protect Visio diagrams via applying locks on various levels.
- [Manipulate the embedded OLE objects in the Visio diagrams](https://docs.aspose.com/display/diagramnet/Manipulate+the+Embedded+OLE+Objects+in+Visio+Diagram).

## Enhancements in Version 20.5

- Ability to determine if one shape is intersecting another shape in the diagram.

## Platform Independence

You can use Aspose.Diagram for .NET to build any type of a 32-bit or 64-bit .NET application including ASP.NET, WCF, WinForms, UWP, .NET Standard, .NET Core etc. You can also use Aspose.Diagram for .NET to build applications with Mono.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Diagram for .NET

Are you ready to give Aspose.Diagram for .NET a try? Simply execute `Install-Package Aspose.Diagram` from Package Manager Console in Visual Studio to fetch the NuGet package. If you already have Aspose.Diagram for .NET and want to upgrade the version, please execute `Update-Package Aspose.Diagram` to get the latest version.

## Load a VSS Template to Create a Visio Diagram with C# Code

You can execute below code snippet to see how Aspose.Diagram API performs in your own environment or check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-diagram/Aspose.Diagram-for-.NET) for other common usage scenarios. 

```csharp
// create a new diagram
var diagram = new Diagram(dataDir + "template.vss");
// add a new rectangle shape
long shapeId = diagram.AddShape(4.25, 5.5, 2, 1, @"Rectangle", 0);
var shape = diagram.Pages[0].Shapes.GetShape(shapeId);
shape.Text.Value.Add(new Txt(@"Rectangle text."));
// add a new hexagon shape
shapeId = diagram.AddShape(7.0, 5.5, 2, 2, @"Hexagon", 0);
shape = diagram.Pages[0].Shapes.GetShape(shapeId);
shape.Text.Value.Add(new Txt(@"Hexagon text."));
// save the diagram in VDX format
diagram.Save(dir + "output.vdx", SaveFileFormat.VDX);
```

## Retrieve Layers of a Visio VSDX Diagram

Aspose.Diagram for .NET allows .NET applications to work with layers of Visio drawings. The following C# code example shows how to fetch all the layers of a VSDX file:

```csharp
// load source Visio diagram
var diagram = new Diagram(dataDir + "Drawing1.vsdx");
// get diagram page
var page = diagram.Pages.GetPage("Page-1");
// iterate through the layers and print properties
foreach (Layer layer in page.PageSheet.Layers)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " + layer.Name.Value);
    Console.WriteLine("Visibility: " + layer.Visible.Value);
    Console.WriteLine("Status: " + layer.Status.Value);
}
```
