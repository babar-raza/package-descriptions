## Using PHP Code to Import Data in Excel Worksheet

```php
require_once realpath(__DIR__ . '/..') . '/vendor/autoload.php';
require_once realpath(__DIR__ . '/..') . '/Utils.php';

use Aspose\Cells\CellsApi;
use Aspose\Cells\AsposeApp;

class Workbook {

    public $cells;

    public function __construct() {
        AsposeApp::$appSID = Utils::appSID;
        AsposeApp::$apiKey = Utils::apiKey;
        $this->cells = new CellsApi();
    }

    public function postImportDataCloudFile() {
        $options = array('{"BatchData":null,"DestinationWorksheet":"Sheet1","IsInsert":false,"ImportDataType":"BatchData","Source":{"FileSourceType":1,"FilePath":"Batch_data_json.txt"}}',
            '{"FirstRow":1,"FirstColumn":2,"IsVertical":true,"Data":null,"DestinationWorksheet":"Sheet1","IsInsert":true,"ImportDataType":"StringArray","Source":{"FileSourceType":1,"FilePath":"Array_string_json.txt"}}',
            '{"FirstRow":1,"FirstColumn":2,"IsVertical":true,"Data":null,"DestinationWorksheet":"Sheet1","IsInsert":true,"ImportDataType":"IntArray","Source":{"FileSourceType":1,"FilePath":"Array_int_json.txt"}}',
            '{"FirstRow":1,"FirstColumn":2,"IsVertical":true,"Data":null,"DestinationWorksheet":"Sheet1","IsInsert":true,"ImportDataType":"DoubleArray","Source":{"FileSourceType":1,"FilePath":"Array_double_json.txt"}}'
            );

        $dataFiles = array("Batch_data_json.txt", "Array_string_json.txt", "Array_int_json.txt", "Array_double_json.txt");

        foreach($options as $index=>$option) {
            // Upload file to Aspose Cloud Storage
            $name = "Book1.xlsx";
            Utils::uploadFile($name);
            $dataFile = $dataFiles[$index];
            Utils::uploadFile($dataFile);

            $body = $option;

            $result = $this->cells->PostImportDataCloudFile($name, $storage = null, $folder = null, $body);
            print_r($result);
        }
    }
}

$workbook = new Workbook();
$workbook->postImportDataCloudFile();
