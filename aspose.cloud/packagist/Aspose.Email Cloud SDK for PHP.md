## Getting Started with Aspose.Email Cloud SDK for PHP

This repository contains Aspose.Email Cloud SDK for PHP source code. To use these SDKs, you will need App SID and App Key which can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) ([free registration](https://id.containerize.com/signup?clientId=prod.discourse.aspose&redirectUrl=https://forum.aspose.cloud/session/sso) is required).

Please check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-php) for the source code and examples.

## How to use the SDK

You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [Packagist distribution](https://packagist.org/packages/aspose/aspose-email-cloud) (recommended).

## Installation via Composer

Aspose.Email Cloud SDK for PHP is available on `Packagist` as the `aspose-email-cloud` package. Run the following command:

```console
composer require aspose/aspose-email-cloud
```

To use the SDK, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Sample usage

To use the API, you should create an `EmailApi` object:

```php
$configuration = new Configuration(); // Aspose\Email\Configuration
$configuration
    ->setAppKey($_ENV["Your App Key"])
    ->setAppSid($_ENV["Your App SID"]);
$api = new EmailApi(
    null, //GuzzleHttp client, will be created automatically if parameter is null
    $configuration);
```

API calls can be synchronous or asynchronous (GuzzleHttp\Promise is used):

```php
$file = "iCalendarFileName.ics"; //iCalendar file name on storage
$folder = "path/to/iCalendar/file/on/storage";
$storage = "First Storage"; //Storage name

$result = $api->getCalendar(new GetCalendarRequest($file, $folder, $storage));
// or
$promise = $api->getCalendarAsync(new GetCalendarRequest($file, $folder, $storage));
$result = $promise->wait();
```

## Detect a person's gender by name

```php
$result = $api->aiNameGenderize(new AiNameGenderizeRequest("John Cane"));
// the result contains a list of hypothesis about a person's gender.
// all hypothesis include score, so you can use the most scored version,
// which will be the first in a list:
echo $result->getValue()[0]->getGender(); //prints "Male"
```
