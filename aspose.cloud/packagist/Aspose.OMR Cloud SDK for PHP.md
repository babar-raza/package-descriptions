## Getting Started with Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK for .NET

This repository contains Aspose.[PRODUCT_NAME] Cloud SDK for PHP source code. To use these SDKs, you will need App SID and App Key which can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) ([free registration](https://id.containerize.com/signup?clientId=prod.discourse.aspose&redirectUrl=https://forum.aspose.cloud/session/sso) is required).

Please check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-[PRODUCT_NAME]-cloud/aspose-[PRODUCT_NAME]-cloud-php) for the source code and examples.

## How to use the SDK

You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [Packagist distribution]() (recommended).

## Installation via Composer

Aspose.[PRODUCT_NAME] Cloud SDK for PHP is available on `Packagist` as the `[PRODUCT_NAME]-cloud-php` package. Run the following command:

```console
composer require aspose/[PRODUCT_NAME]-cloud-php
```

To use the SDK, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Sample usage

```php
```

## Limitations

- Recognition process works well with the bubbles which are at least 75% filled.
- Works on perspective (side viewed/out of focus) & rotated images under certain conditions, e.g., rotation angle within 25 degrees.
- OMR operation will show results only in text format.
- Performing OCR operation is not supported for now.
