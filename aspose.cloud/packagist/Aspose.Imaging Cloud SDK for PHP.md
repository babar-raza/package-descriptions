## Resize PSD Image using PHP Code

```php
namespace Aspose\Imaging\Examples;

use Aspose\Imaging\Model\Requests\CreateResizedImageRequest;
use Aspose\Imaging\Model\Requests\ResizeImageRequest;

class ResizeImage extends ImagingBase
{
    function __construct($imagingApi)
    {
        parent::__construct($imagingApi);
        $this->PrintHeader("Resize an image example");
    }

    /**
     * Resizes the image.
     */
    public function ResizeImageFromStorage()
    {
        echo "Resize an image from cloud storage" . PHP_EOL;

        // Upload local image to Cloud Storage
        $this->UploadSampleImageToCloud();

        // Please refer to https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/imagingcloud/Supported+File+Formats#SupportedFileFormats-Resize
        // for possible output formats
        $format = "gif";
        $newWidth = 100;
        $newHeight = 150;
        $folder = $this->CloudPath; // Input file is saved at the Examples folder in the storage
        $storage = null; // We are using default Cloud Storage

        $resizeImageRequest = new ResizeImageRequest($this->GetSampleImageFileName(), $newWidth, $newHeight, $format,
            $folder, $storage);
        echo "Call ResizeImage with params: new width: ${newWidth}, new height: ${newHeight}, $format: ${format}" . PHP_EOL;

        $updatedImage = self::$imagingApi->resizeImage($resizeImageRequest);
        $this->SaveUpdatedSampleImageToOutput($updatedImage, false);

        echo PHP_EOL;
    }

    /**
     * Gets the name of the example image file.
     * @return string
     */
