```php
public function getDrawingSaveAs()
    {
        $localName = "galeon.stl";
        $outputFormat = "jpg";
        $remoteName = $localName;
        $subfolder = "";
        $fullName = self::$baseRemoteFolder . $subfolder . $remoteName;
        $destName = self::$baseTestOut . $remoteName ."." . $outputFormat;

        $file = realpath(__DIR__ . self::$relativeRootPath) . '/TestData/' . $localName;
        $putRequest = new \Aspose\Storage\Model\Requests\PutCreateRequest($fullName, $file);
        $this->storage->PutCreate($putRequest);

        $request = new \Aspose\CAD\Model\Requests\GetDrawingSaveAsRequest($remoteName, $outputFormat, $folder=trim(self::$baseRemoteFolder . $subfolder), null, null);

        list($response, $code, $headers) = $this->CAD->getDrawingSaveAsWithHttpInfo($request);
        Assert::assertEquals(200, $code);
    }
```
