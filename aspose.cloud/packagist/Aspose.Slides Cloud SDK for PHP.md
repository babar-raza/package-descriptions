## Getting Started with Aspose.Slides Cloud SDK for PHP

This repository contains Aspose.Slides Cloud SDK for PHP source code. To use these SDKs, you will need App SID and App Key which can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) ([free registration](https://id.containerize.com/signup?clientId=prod.discourse.aspose&redirectUrl=https://forum.aspose.cloud/session/sso) is required).

Please check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-slides-cloud/aspose-slides-cloud-php) for the source code and examples.

## How to use the SDK

You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [Packagist distribution](https://packagist.org/packages/aspose/slides-sdk-php) (recommended).

## Installation

From the command line:

```console
composer require aspose/slides-sdk-php
```

## Convert a PPTX document to PDF format using PHP Code

The example code below uses the `slides-sdk-php` library:

```php
use Aspose\Slides\Cloud\Sdk\Api\Configuration;
use Aspose\Slides\Cloud\Sdk\Api\SlidesApi;
use Aspose\Slides\Cloud\Sdk\Model\ExportFormat;
use Aspose\Slides\Cloud\Sdk\Model\Requests\PostSlidesConvertRequest;

$config = new Configuration();
$config->setAppSid("MyAppSid");
$config->setAppKey("MyAppKey");
$api = new SlidesApi(null, $config);
$request = new PostSlidesConvertRequest(ExportFormat::PDF, fopen("MyPresentation.pptx", 'r'));
$result = $api->postSlidesConvert($request);
echo "My PDF was saved to " . $result->getPathname();
```
