Python Cloud SDK wraps Aspose.Imaging REST API so you could seamlessly integrate image file creation, manipulation & conversion features into your own Node.js applications.

# Create, Manipulate & Convert Images in the Cloud

[Aspose.Imaging Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging) is a true [REST API](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging/) that enables you to perform a wide range of image processing operations including creation, manipulation and conversion in the cloud, with zero initial cost. 

## Image Processing Features

- Export images to variety of other formats.
- Fetch or update properties of cloud hosted images.
- Scale, flip, crop, rotate and export images with a single API call.
- Update image parameters of JPEG2000 & WEBP images.
- Access multi-frame TIFF image and extract the desired frames.
- Merge multiple TIFF images.
- Imaging AI operations:
	- Content-based image search
	- Image duplicates search
	- Image search by custom registered tags
	- Image comparison and similarity detection
	- Image features extraction (for now, AKAZE detector is supported)

## Read & Write Image Formats

BMP, GIF, JPEG, JPEG2000, PSD, TIFF, WEBP, PNG, WMF, EMF, SVG

## Save Images As

PDF

## Read Images From

DJVU, DICOM, CDR, CMX, ODG, DNG

## Storage API Support
Since version 19.4, SDK includes support of storage operations for better user experience and unification, so now there's no need to use 2 different SDKs!

It gives the ability to:

- Upload, download, copy, move and delete files, including versions handling (if you are using Cloud storage that supports this feature - true by default).
- Create, copy, move and delete folders.
- Copy and move files and folders accross separate storages in scope of a single operation.
- Check if certain file, folder or storage exists.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK for Python

Firstly, create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) to get your application information and free quota to use the API. Now execute `pip install aspose-imaging-cloud` from the command line to get the SDK. Finally, import the dependencies to your code with `import aspose-imaging-cloud`.

The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK is to read the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/imagingcloud/Developer+Guide) whereas the [Getting Started](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/imagingcloud/Getting+Started) section will help you understand the common concepts.
