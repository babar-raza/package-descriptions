Python Cloud SDK wraps Aspose.Imaging REST API so you could seamlessly integrate image file creation, manipulation & conversion features into your own Node.js applications.

# Create, Manipulate & Convert Images in the Cloud

[Aspose.Imaging Cloud](https://products.aspose.cloud/imaging) is a true [REST API](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/imaging/) that enables you to perform a wide range of image processing operations including creation, manipulation and conversion in the cloud, with zero initial cost.

## Storage API Support

Since version 19.4, SDK includes support of storage operations for better user experience and unification, so now there's no need to use 2 different SDKs!

It gives the ability to:

- Upload, download, copy, move and delete files, including versions handling (if you are using Cloud storage that supports this feature - true by default).
- Create, copy, move and delete folders.
- Copy and move files and folders accross separate storages in scope of a single operation.
- Check if certain file, folder or storage exists.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Imaging Cloud SDK for Python

Firstly, create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) to get your application information and free quota to use the API. Now execute `pip install aspose-imaging-cloud` from the command line to get the SDK. Finally, import the dependencies to your code with `import aspose-imaging-cloud`.

The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK is to read the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/imagingcloud/Developer+Guide) whereas the [Getting Started](https://docs.aspose.cloud/display/imagingcloud/Getting+Started) section will help you understand the common concepts.
