Python Cloud SDK wraps Aspose.OMR REST API so you could seamlessly integrate OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) features to your own Python applications.

[Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK for Python](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/python) allows to define and generate OMR templates with support for numerous types of elements, such as, text, grid, multi-column answer sheets, and images. Using Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK for Node.js, developers can also define answer grading rules to perform automatic grading of OMR mark sheets, surveys, questionnaires & quizzes while extracting the OMR data to CSV format.
