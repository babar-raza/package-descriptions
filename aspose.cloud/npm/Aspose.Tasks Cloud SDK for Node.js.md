Node.js Cloud SDK wraps Aspose.Tasks REST API so you could seamlessly integrate Microsoft Project® & Primavera® P6 document generation, manipulation, conversion & inspection features into your own Node.js applications.

# Project Processing in the Cloud

[Aspose.Tasks Cloud SDK for Node.js](https://products.aspose.cloud/tasks/nodejs) allows to retrieve project tasks and documents to process & manipulate without installing Microsoft Project or Primavera P6. Aspose.Tasks Cloud SDK for Node.js allows your to fetch existing assignments, add new project assignments, change task parent, change position of the tasks within the project hierarchy, add a project calendar along with calendar exceptions, get VBA project, get time-scaled data of project, get a collection of all work weeks belonging to a project, and more.

const request: GetTasksRequest = { name: "template.mpp", folder: "documents", storage: ""}

tasksApi.getTasks(request)
    .then((result) => {
        // Deal with a result
        console.log(result.response.statusCode);
        console.log(result.body);
    })
    .catch(function(err) {
        // Deal with an error
        console.log(err.reponse.statusCode);
