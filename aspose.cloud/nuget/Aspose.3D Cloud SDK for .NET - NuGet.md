Aspose.3D Cloud SDK for .NET REST API provides you a seamless way to integrate 3D object manipulation features into your cloud-based C# & other .NET apps.

Aspose.3D Cloud SDK for .NET is available under an MIT license. It enhances your C# code to create 3D entities, objects and models in the cloud. Your .NET cloud-based apps would be able to work with various 3D entities, such as, box, sphere, plane, torus, & cylinder. Aspose.3D Cloud SDK for .NET allows your C# cloud apps to extract raw data or 3D content from Adobe Acrobat 3D PDF files.

## 3D Processing Features

- Create 3D entities (Box, Sphere, Plane, Torus, Cylinder).
- Perform processing of 3D models and attributes.
- Perform transformation, translation, rotation & scaling of 3D objects.
- Conversion of 3D files to another format.
- Convert whole of the 3D file or convert a specific part only.
- Extract 3D scenes and export to various formats.
- Perform parametric modeling, 3D modeling & data processing.
- Create cloud-based folder structure & perform cloud-based conversion of 3D files.
- Extract raw data or 3D content from a password-protected 3D PDF file.
- Supports working with triangulate meshes, triangulate whole or part of the 3D scene.
- Address nodes by object addressing path or remove nodes with attached light or camera.
- Remove 3D objects from a scene.

## Using C# to Convert FBX 3D file to PDF

The following code sample demonstrates, how to convert a 3D FBX file to PDF using C# code:

```csharp
string name = "Input.fbx";
string newformat = "pdf";
string newfilename = "Output.pdf";
string folder = "3DTest";
bool isOverwrite = true;
string storage = "First Storage";
var response = threeDCloudApi.PostConvertByFormatWithHttpInfo(name, newformat, newfilename, folder, isOverwrite, storage);
Assert.AreEqual(response.StatusCode, 200);
```
