## Using C# to Convert FBX 3D file to PDF

The following code sample demonstrates, how to convert a 3D FBX file to PDF using C# code:

```csharp
string name = "Input.fbx";
string newformat = "pdf";
string newfilename = "Output.pdf";
string folder = "3DTest";
bool isOverwrite = true;
string storage = "First Storage";
var response = threeDCloudApi.PostConvertByFormatWithHttpInfo(name, newformat, newfilename, folder, isOverwrite, storage);
Assert.AreEqual(response.StatusCode, 200);
```
