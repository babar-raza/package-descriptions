## Using C# to Get Image Properties of a DXF File

The following code sample demonstrates, how to retrieve image properties of a DXF file format drawing using C# code:

```csharp
 CADApi cadApi = new CADApi(AppKey, AppSid);
string fileName = "Input.dxf";

// Upload document to Cloud Storage
uploadFileToCloudStorage(fileName);

var request = new GetImagePropertiesRequest(fileName, null, null);
var properties = cadApi.GetImageProperties(request);
```

## Using C# Convert DWG CAD drawing to PDF Format

The following code snippet elaborates, how to convert a DWG file to PDF file format in the cloud using C# code:

```csharp
CADApi cadApi = new CADApi(AppKey, AppSid);
string fileName = "Input.dwg";
string formatToExport = "pdf";
string destFileName = "Output.pdf";

// Upload document to Cloud Storage
uploadFileToCloudStorage(fileName);

var request = new GetImageSaveAsRequest(fileName, formatToExport, null, null, null, null);
var responseStream = cadApi.GetImageSaveAs(request);

// Save the output file to disk
saveFileToDisk(responseStream, destFileName);
```
