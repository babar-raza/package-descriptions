## Convert PPTX Presentation to JPEG Format via C# Code

The following C# code sample elaborates, how to easily convert a cloud-based Microsoft PowerPoint presentation PPTX file to JPEG image format via REST API:

```csharp
PostSlidesSaveAsRequest request = new PostSlidesSaveAsRequest();
// the presentation that is to be converted
request.Name="Input_Presentation.pptx";
// the export format for the PPTX file
request.Format=ExportFormat.Jpeg;

return request;
```

## Use C# to Replace Specific Text on the Selected PPTX Slide

The following code sample demonstrates, how to replace a specific piece of text on the presentation slide of your choice using C# code:

```csharp
PostSlidesSlideReplaceTextRequest request = new PostSlidesSlideReplaceTextRequest();
// slide on which the text to be updated is present
request.SlideIndex = 0;
// name of the presentation that contains the text
request.Name = "Input_Presentation.pptx";
// text string that needs to be updated
request.OldValue = "This text is going to be replaced.";
// new text string that replaces the older value
request.NewValue = "This text replaces the older text.";
// the text manipulation is not case-sensitive
request.IgnoreCase = true;
return request;
```
