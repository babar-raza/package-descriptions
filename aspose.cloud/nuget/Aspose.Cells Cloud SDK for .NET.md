## Using C# to Add a New Worksheet to an Excel File

The following code snippet demonstrates how to add a new worksheet to a Microsoft Excel document using C# code:

```csharp
CellsWorksheetsApi instance = new CellsWorksheetsApi(GetConfiguration());
string name = "Input.xlsx";
string sheetName = "Sheet1";
int? position = 1;
string sheettype = "VB";
string folder = null;
UpdateDataFile(folder, name);
var response = instance.CellsWorksheetsPutAddNewWorksheet(name, sheetName, position, sheettype, folder);
```

## Using C# to Convert an Excel File to another File Format

The following code example elaborates how you can use C# code to convert an Excel document to another file format in the cloud:

```csharp
// Upload source file to aspose cloud storage
storageApi.PutCreate(inputfileName, "", "", System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(Common.GetDataDir() + inputfileName));

// Invoke Aspose.Cells Cloud SDK API to convert excel workbook to different format
SaveResponse apiResponse = cellsApi.PostDocumentSaveAs(inputfileName, outputFileName, isAutoFitRows, isAutoFitColumns, storage, folder, body);
```
