## Convert PDF File to DOC Format via C# Code

The following code sample demonstrates how to convert a PDF file to DOC format using C# code via REST API:

```csharp
string name = "Input_Document.pdf";
using (Stream stream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(Path.Combine("", name)))
    {
        string resFileName = "Output_Document.doc";

        var response = api.PutPdfInRequestToDoc(Path.Combine(FolderName, resFileName), file: stream);
        Console.WriteLine(response);
    }
```

## Use C# Code to Optimize PDF Document

The following C# code elaborates how to optimize various factors, such as, image compression & image quality, of a PDF document via REST API:

```csharp
const string name = "Input_Document.pdf";
UploadFile(name, name);

var options = new OptimizeOptions(
    AllowReusePageContent: false,
    CompressImages: true,
    ImageQuality: 100,
    RemoveUnusedObjects: true,
    RemoveUnusedStreams: true,
    UnembedFonts: true);
var response = api.PostOptimizeDocument(name, options, folder: FolderName);
Console.WriteLine(response);
```
