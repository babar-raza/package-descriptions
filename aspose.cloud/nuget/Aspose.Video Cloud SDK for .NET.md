var localName = "sample.avi";
var remoteName = "TestGetVideo.avi";
var fullName = Path.Combine(this.dataFolder, remoteName);

this.StorageApi.PutCreate(fullName, null, null, File.ReadAllBytes(BaseTestContext.GetDataDir() + localName));
var request = new GetVideoRequest(remoteName, this.dataFolder);
var actual = this.VideoApi.GetVideo(request);
```

## Convert AVI to MP4 Video File using C# Code

The following C# code sample elaborates, how to convert a video AVI file to MP4 video file in the cloud:

```csharp
var localName = "sample.avi";
