## Export an Image to PDF Format via C# Code

This code sample demonstrates, how to convert an image to PDF format using C# code via REST API:

```csharp
string format = "pdf"; // specify the export output format
string outPath = null; // Path to updated file (if this is empty, response contains streamed image)
string storage = null; // Cloud Storage name

var request = new CreateSavedImageAsRequest(inputImageStream, format, outPath, storage);

Console.WriteLine($"Call CreateSavedImageAs with params: format:{format}");

using (Stream updatedImage = this.ImagingApi.CreateSavedImageAs(request))
    {
        SaveUpdatedImageToOutput(updatedImage, true, format);
    }
```
