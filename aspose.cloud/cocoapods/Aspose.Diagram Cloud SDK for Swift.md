## Getting Started

Please, add the following cocoapods to your project.

You want to add pod `'AsposeDiagramCloud', '~> 19.10'` similar to the following to your Podfile:

```console
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'AsposeDiagramCloud', '~> 19.10'
end
```

Then run a pod install inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.

Alternatively to give it a test run, run the command:

`pod try AsposeDiagramCloud`

## Examples

Please, look at [Examples](https://github.com/aspose-diagram-cloud/aspose-diagram-cloud-swift/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md) document for basic usage or use the [Examples](https://github.com/aspose-diagram-cloud/aspose-diagram-cloud-swift/blob/master/Examples) folder for more sophisticated scenarios.

## Aspose Cloud-hosted service VS on-premise deployment (experimental feature)

Starting from v19.10, you can choose either to use Aspose Cloud-hosted image processing service (the standard way) or the Docker image from Docker Hub deployed on-premise to serve the requests. The details about key differences and deployment process will be described on the dedicated Docker Hub page as soon as it's released.
