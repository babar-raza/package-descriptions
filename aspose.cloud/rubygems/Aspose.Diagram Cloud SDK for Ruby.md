## Getting Started with Aspose.Diagram Cloud SDK for Ruby

You do not need to install anything to get started with Aspose.Diagram Cloud SDK for Ruby. All you need to do is create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information.

Please check the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-diagram-cloud/aspose-diagram-cloud-dotnet) for other common usage scenarios.

## Usage

Please, add the following [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/aspose_diagram_cloud) to your project.

```ruby
gem install aspose_diagram_cloud
```

### Aspose Cloud-hosted service VS on-premise deployment (experimental feature)

Starting from v19.10, you can choose either to use Aspose Cloud-hosted image processing service (the standard way) or the Docker image from Docker Hub deployed on-premise to serve the requests. The details about key differences and deployment process will be described on the dedicated Docker Hub page as soon as it's released.

To succeed with your on-premise service usage by the SDK, you need to:

- Use the new API class constructor with grantType parameter, clientId and clientSecret parameters.

    ```ruby
    $diagramApi = AsposeDiagramCloud::DiagramApi.new($grant_type,$client_id,$client_secret)
    ```

- Set storage or storageName parameters for each request where they're present (mandatory!).
