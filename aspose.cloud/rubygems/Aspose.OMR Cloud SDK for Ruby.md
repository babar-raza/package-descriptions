# .NET REST API for OMR Processing

This Cloud SDK enables you to [perform Optical Mark Recognition (OMR)](https://products.aspose.cloud/omr/net) operations on human-marked data from within your cloud-based C#, ASP.NET & other .NET apps.

## OMR Processing Features

- Perform recognition of scanned photos and images for OMR operations.
- Ability to perform OMR on rotated & perspective (within 25 deg) photos.
- Extract & recognize human-marked data from scanned tests, exams, surveys etc.
- Supports the export of OMR results to CSV file format.
- Use textual markup to generate OMR templates, generate surveys and test sheets.

## Getting Started with Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK for Ruby

The complete source code is available at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby). You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [RubyGem](https://rubygems.org/gems/aspose_omr_cloud) (recommended).

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.3 and later

## Installation

### Clone repository

Clone `aspose-omr-cloud` with submodules:

`git clone https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby.git --recurse-submodules`

### Build a gem

To build the Ruby code into a gem:

`gem build aspose_omr_cloud.gemspec`

Then either install the gem locally:

`gem install ./aspose_omr_cloud-18.8.0.gem`

(for development, `run gem install --dev ./aspose_omr_cloud-18.8.0.gem` to install the development dependencies)

or publish the gem to a gem hosting service, e.g. [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

Finally add this to the Gemfile:

`gem 'aspose_omr_cloud', '~> 18.8.0'`

### Install from Git

Please access the Aspose.OMR Cloud SDK for Ruby [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby) and add the following in the `Gemfile`:

`gem 'aspose_omr_cloud', :git => 'https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby.git'`

### Include the Ruby code directly

Include the Ruby code directly using `-I` as follows:

`ruby -Ilib script.rb`

## Optional requirements

To take full advantage of Aspose.OMR for Cloud, `aspose/storage-sdk-ruby` is required. Just run `gem install aspose_storage_cloud`. You may refer to official [Aspose Storage SDK](https://github.com/aspose-storage-cloud/aspose-storage-cloud-ruby) to get more information.

## Usage

### Receive Cloud Keys

Aspose.Cloud credentials are required to use Aspose.OMR for Cloud API. You can acquire App SID and App Key by registering at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/). It will take only a couple of minutes.

### Update submodule

Make sure you've cloned [aspose-omr-cloud-demo-data](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/) submodule, that contains all data required to run demo. In case you are missing submodules use the following git commands to initialize and update them:

```console
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Authentication

- Library uses `OAUTH2` internally

## OMR Demo

You can check out [OMR Demo](https://github.com/aspose-omr-cloud/aspose-omr-cloud-ruby/blob/master/demo) project to get started with Aspose.OMR for Cloud.

## Limitations

- Recognition process works well with the bubbles which are at least 75% filled.
- Works on perspective (side viewed/out of focus) & rotated images under certain conditions, e.g., rotation angle within 25 degrees.
- OMR operation will show results only in text format.
- Performing OCR operation is not supported for now.
