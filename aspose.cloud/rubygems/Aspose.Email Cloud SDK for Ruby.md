## Getting Started with Aspose.Email Cloud SDK for Ruby

You do not need to install anything to get started with Aspose.Email Cloud SDK for Ruby. Just create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) and get your application information.

The complete source code is available at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-email-cloud/aspose-email-cloud-dotnet).

## Prerequisites

To use this SDK, you need an App SID and an App Key; they can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (it requires free registration in Aspose Cloud for this).

## Installation

You can either directly use it in your project via source code or get [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/aspose_email_cloud).

## Usage examples

To use the API, you should create an `EmailApi` object:

```ruby
api = EmailApi.new('Your App Key', 'Your App Sid')
```

## Business cards recognition API

See examples below:

### Parse business card images to VCard contact files

```ruby
# Upload a business card image to storage
storage = 'First Storage'
image = File.new('path/to/image')
image_file_name = 'someFileName.png' # Supports different image formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, GIF, etc.
api.upload_file(
    UploadFileRequestData.new(image_file_name, image, storage))
out_folder = 'some/folder/on/storage' # Business card recognition results will be saved here
api.create_folder(CreateFolderRequestData.new(out_folder, storage))
# Call business card recognition action
result = api.ai_bcr_parse_storage(AiBcrParseStorageRequestData.new(
    AiBcrParseStorageRq.new(
        nil,
        [AiBcrImageStorageFile.new(true, StorageFileLocation.new(storage, '', fileName))],
        StorageFolderLocation.new(storage, out_folder))))
# Get file name from a recognition result
contact_file = result.value[0] # result.value can contain multiple files, if we sent multicard images or multiple images
# You can download the VCard file, which produced by the recognition method
downloaded = api.download_file(DownloadFileRequestData.new(
    "#{contact_file.folder_path}/#{contact_file.file_name}", contact_file.storage))
# Let's print file contents:
content = IO.read(downloaded)
puts content
# Also, you can get VCard object properties’ list using Contact API
contact_properties = api.get_contact_properties(
    GetContactPropertiesRequestData.new(
        'vcard',
        contact_file.file_name,
        contact_file.folder_path,
        contact_file.storage))
# All VCard’s properties are available as a list. Complex properties are represented as hierarchical structures.
# Let's print all primitive properties’ values:
contact_properties.internal_properties
    .filter {|property| property.type == 'PrimitiveObject'}
    .each {|property| puts "Property name:#{property.name}, value:#{property.value}"}
```

## Name API

See examples below:

### Detect a person's gender by name

```ruby
result = api.ai_name_genderize(
    AiNameGenderizeRequestData.new('John Cane'))
# the result contains a list of hypothesis about a person's gender.
# all hypothesis include score, so you can use the most scored version, which will be the first in a list:
puts result.value[0].gender # prints 'Male'
```

### Format person's name using defined format

```ruby
result = api.ai_name_format(
    AiNameFormatRequestData.new('Mr. John Michael Cane', nil, nil, nil, nil, '%t%L%f%m'))
puts result.name # prints 'Mr. Cane J. M.'
```
